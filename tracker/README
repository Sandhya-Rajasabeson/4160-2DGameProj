Project description: Player shoots black hearts, gets points with pink hears and extra lives with rainbow
hearts. Game has a night mode with hidden hearts. Godmode with no death.
I created the player and bullet sprite from scratch and I found gifs of the hearts online on this profile
on giphy (https://giphy.com/simonfalk/) and I converted them into sprite sheets using this online
gif to sprite sheet maker (https://ezgif.com/gif-to-sprite)

The easiest part of this project:
lighting

Problems that I had in completing this project:
restart issues that showed some issues with my constructors that were a bit
hard to find

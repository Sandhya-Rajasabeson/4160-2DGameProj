Project description: player must shoot black hearts that if they collide with they die. there will be a cloud that emits
different colored hearts, some will give faster ammo, some will give more lives, some will make them bigger or go faster
. the player will start with 3 lives and dies when they hit a black heart.
I created the player and bullet sprite from scratch and I found gifs of the hearts online on this profile
on giphy (https://giphy.com/simonfalk/) and I converted them into sprite sheets using this online
gif to sprite sheet maker (https://ezgif.com/gif-to-sprite)

The easiest part of this project:
shooting

Problems that I had in completing this project:
Did not realize that if you exit the window during an explosion you will have memory leaks,
i spent five hours trying to fix memory leaks that just weren't there. but i learnt a Lot more about
polymorphism, inheritance and how it relates to virtual vs non virtual destructors so that was honestly
amazing.

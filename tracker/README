Project description: player character is a biker who has to jump over obstacles on the bridge
(like people, birds. boxes etc), collect "good hearts" which will be rainbow colored, and
avoid "bad hearts" which are dark colored. there will be floating clouds of spinning hearts
which will shoot out either colored or dark hearts. the game ends when the player dies.
I created the player sprite from scratch and I found gifs of the hearts online on this profile
on giphy (https://giphy.com/simonfalk/) and I converted them into sprite sheets using this online
gif to sprite sheet maker (https://ezgif.com/gif-to-sprite)

The easiest part of this project:
HUD, thank you Dr.Malloy! :'))))'

Problems that I had in completing this project:
I was running a fever with a really bad sore throat and cold situation while I was
coding the hardest part of this project which slowed things down considerably. But the moment
I took a nap for a few hours I came back and was able to fix my issues in less than an hours.
Moral of the story is to sleep.
